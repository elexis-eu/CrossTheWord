# Cross the word (Front-end) 
“Cross the word” is a crossword puzzle video game developed for Android mobile phones.
The application Front-End is realized using Libgdx, a Java framework for multiplatform game development. A simple guide can be found [here.](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)

# Getting Started
Here we explain how to start working with the project. First of all, the project must be downloaded from the git repositories and two suggested softwares should be installed:
Android Studio: this software is used to manage the Front-end code. It includes Android SDK.
Eclipse JEE or IntelliJ IDEA: this software is used to manage the Back-end or Builder code. It can be used for the Front-end code too, but Android SDK needs to be installed too.


## How to import Cross the word on Android Studio or Eclipse:

First Method: 

* On Android Studio: File > New > Project from version control > GIT
Subsequently, you GitLab username and password should be inserted as well.
* On Eclipse : Import > Git > Projects from Git
Some Eclipse version does not natively include Git plugin, so it should be installed as well.

Now everything is set up to start working with Cross the word.

Second Method (if the first one didn’t succeeded)
* Download libgdx setup from [here.](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html)
* Clone the projects on your pc from Git.
* Import the project from Eclipse -> import -> git -> project from git -> import new wizard project -> gradle
* Download Android SDK (it is already installed on Android Studio)
* Execute the libgdx jar file.
* Check that local.properties and other files are correct
